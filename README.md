This is a repo for the final project for the Structural Bioinformatics course.

The Predictor software is contained in the contacts_classifier.py script. Directions for execution: 
- It should be called with four arguments that represent the location of the input pdb file, configuration file, output directory, and model.
- In this repo are given examples of pdb file (2ghv.cif), configuration file (configuration.json), and the final model is also attached (final_model.f5).
- In order to be able to execute the script please make sure to specify the exact location of the dssp_file, rama_file and atchley_file 
in the configuration.json script.

Output from the contacts_classifier.py script:
